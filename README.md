Select 'File > Open File' to choose the data file.

Select 'File > Generate Random' to create a random test data file (random.txt).

Select 'File > Export Convex Hull' to save Convex Hull in a data file (convex_hull.txt). It will be formatted according to the input data file format.

Input data file format:

Number of Points  
[X1, Y1]  
[X2, Y2]  
[X3, Y3]  
...  

The entire Point Set and the points belonging to the Convex Hull will be listed in the Data tab. The Point Set and Convex Hull will be displayed in the Graph tab.
